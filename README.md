# bit-docs Playground

Remix this project and add files to the `docs` directory, or edit `playground.md`.

Then visit your remixed project:

  - Locally at <http://localhost:3000/>
  - Or click "Show [Live]" on Glitch.

As you play with `bit-docs` tags to see how they render, the build will autorun, and the web page will auto-refresh.

You might have to hard-refresh already visited pages after making certain changes.
